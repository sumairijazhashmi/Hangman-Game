# Hangman-Game

Implemented a console-based hangman game in C++ with object oriented programming. 

Rules:
- A player has 10 tries to make an incorrect guess of a letter
- If a letter is correctly guessed, then all instances of that letter are shown
- If an already guessed letter is guessed again:
    - if it is incorrect, then the number of tries decreases
    - if it is correct, then nothing happens
